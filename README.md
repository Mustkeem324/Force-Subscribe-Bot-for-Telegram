# Force-Subscribe-Bot-for-Telegram
This is a Telegram bot script designed to enforce subscription to a specific channel before allowing users to participate in a group chat. The bot sends a welcome message to new users who have already subscribed to the required channel, and restricts the messaging capabilities of those who haven't subscribed until they do so.
